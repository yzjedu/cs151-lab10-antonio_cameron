## Objective:
### What were you supposed to learn/accomplish?
In this lab we were meant to create a program that would read a file, create a list with the data from that file, 
and then add a new variable to each line in the list.

## Procedure:
### What steps were followed and what techniques did you use to solve the problem?
First we created an outline of what we wanted to do, then we created an algorithm, and then we began to write the code. 

### What were the Key concepts explored?
The key concepts explored in this lab were working with lists and reading and writing to files.

## Results:
### Did your results match what you expected to get?
Results matched what we expected, so yes.

## Reflection:
### What challenges did you encounter?
Making a new file and having the data in the updated movies list be appended to it was difficult to figure out.

### Did you overcome them, and how?
Figuring out how to make that happen took a lot of trial and error, but through debugging it was eventually figured out.

### Any key takeaways?
Practice more with working with files.

### Do you think you learned what you were supposed to learn for this lab?
I think that I have a better understanding of how to create programs that use files, but I should practice more.

### What was it like working with your partner?
Working with Cameron didn't go that great. Working with him in lab was fine, but we had agreed that he would do the first half
of the code and the algorithm, and that I would complete the rest of it, but he didn't push it until the day the lab was due.
I am partly to blame for that because I didn't reach out, but he still should've made sure he had pushed his work. And when he did
push his work, it was less than half of the lab. His code was disjointed and I had to tweak a lot of it, and I also had to redo 
the entire algorithm, including the parts that covered the code that he wrote.
